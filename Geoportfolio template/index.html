		This website is the geoportfolio of Thomas Henry which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOMODO). The website contains
		information that is academically and professionally related to the field of Surveying.
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia in September 2000, I am a part time student enrolled in the 
		Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. 
		
		My surveying-related interests include working with 3D scanners, collection and analysis of
		aerial imagery and creating 3D models using spatial data. I am not currently doing any surveying related projects due to a lighter load this semester.
		Although I am completing my work experience with Northpoint Surveying, an civil surveying firm who do mostly construction work.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include playing ice and field hockey! More detailed information can be found in the About page!

	<div class="bar"><h2>Cartography</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and an introductory first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul>
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Below is one of the three maps (practical 2) that I have created as part of my course:

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you gave done yourself-->
	<div class="academic-intro">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2020 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park. Students did not 
			assist in the data collection as the 2020 pandemic was in full swing.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD, the inputted into ArcGIS. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene while the raw data was
			modified in ArcMap. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2022) within the geospatial science industry. The main companies that I have worked at 
		is Northpoint Survey. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at Northpoint along with an

	<div class="job-overview">
		During my time at Northpoint Survey I have gained valuable experience and training, the company is mostly a construction surveying company with some minor civil
		jobs that get thrown our way. The companies main contracts are with multiple plumbers and formworkers who require set out for their concrete pours. There is also a 
		large amount of work for us at the airport, Northpoint is the airports first choice for surveying and as such we complete a lot of work out there.
		<p>
		My other responsibilities involve collecting and coordinating 3D scan data. 3D scans are incredibly easy to set up and require minimal training to collect good data.
		Coordinating the data is completed back at the office, the software we use to coordinate 3D data is Trimble RealWorks.
			<p></p>
		Northpoint uses almost exclusively Trimble surveying equipment, including the robotic total stations, gps receivers and handheld controllers, the 3D scanners used are FARO brand.
